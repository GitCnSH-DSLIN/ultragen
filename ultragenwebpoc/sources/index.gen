    <p class='mb-0'>Initially with a few features MetaGen grew and I felt a need to expand their capabilities to a point the actual version could not go anymore. So I rewrote, or better saying, wrote a fully new template engine based on the good syntax obtained, but with a lot of more functions and possibilities. One of them, use the UltraGen as a web template engine.</p>

<p>Initially MetaGen (stands for Metadata Generator) was only capable of convert files and persist them in the system. UltraGen features the <b>"live"</b> mode for use in websites</p>
