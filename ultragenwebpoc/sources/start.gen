subtitle;How to use UltraGen?
body;<p>UltraGen syntax is very simple. Basically you write a template text and put the pieces you want to be replaced by dinamic text between the chosen symbols. The default symbols are "{{" to open a dinamic field and "}}" to close. You can change this symbols but always the symbol is a repetition from what you choose. If you choose "<" to open and ">" to close, then in your template you have to write "<<" to open and ">>" to close. The change of the symbols can be done any where in the template. You can even change it in a part of the template and then go back to the default or other symbol you want. Symbols that are used with other functions will give an unpredicted result.</p>
<p>You can print three types of values in ypur templates: gen sourced, declared variables and function provided. Every function used in a template is used for print something. No logic are interpreted from functions. You can do interventions on the normal behavior of interpreter with the <b>overrides</b>. Overrides are special declarations that change some predefined functions of template interpreter. Overrides are also used to declare variables. Any override not known will be interepreted as a variable. A word with no symbol and not in quotes will be searched in the gen file source. A function will be processed and their evaluated value will be printed.</p>
<p>UltraGen templates have a philosophy of "never breaking". If you ask for a value that does not exist the template will be rendered normally showing a blank space in the field no value could be get.</p>
<p>For use UltraGen in your site or any use case of generating dynamic text you need, just put the file in the folder you need. Depending on your use case you'll need some other files or folders to attend your need.</p>
<p>UltraGen is fully agnostic, it is, text in any strucuture can be generated. The extension of the resultant text is given by the extension of the template. It will help you in syntax highlighting by your text editor automatically.</p>
<p>UltraGen is highly automatable and expansible. You can input external process, as a function that manipulate the strings in a way UltraGen doesn't cover or execute a external process with the gen sources before or after a template is processed.</p>
