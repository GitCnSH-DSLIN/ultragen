<p>Where UltraGen can be used and for what it serves? Any application where you need to create structured text dinamically or use this data to control processes. UltraGen can do a little more then convert texts. It has the feature to persist these texts, unlike a common web development based template engine. So it's intended to use either on web or desktop. When you need to show web pages and you want an easy way to do this and don't need a strongly dynamic site. Anyway, UltraGen may be used easily with any language or well-knonw framework due to their "drives". Drives are abstractions that encapsulate the processes call making them look like a simple function called in your system.</p>

        <h4>Fast</h4>
        <p>Unlike the most of now time template engines, UltraGen is not based on scripts language. It's true language machine being executed. It make its processing being very fast. In some real world applications, UltraGen processed a thousand of files with dozens of lines each in less than 10 seconds.</p>
        <p>Obviously, the time processing of a great batch of files will depend on performance of your storage</p>

        <h4>Agnostic</h4>
        <p>UltraGen is a binary application, this is, it doesn't depend of inspires any language. It's truly independent, although some resemblance with other well-known languages was aimed. The casing style searched to remember JavaScript. The overrides - that you will learn ahead - came from Laravel Blade.</p>
        <p>UltraGen was designed to be easy to implement. It was made with focus on users at its first version and evolved to be a powerful tool of developing without lose its essence.</p>

        <h4>Expandable</h4>
        <p>Besides of its many built-in functions, it can be easily expanded to attend other demands. By default, when a not known function is called from the template, it searches for an <i>Expansion</i> or and <i>Plugin</i> to process the request.</p>
        <p>UltraGen can also execute external processes in separate threads the way you need with its "Async Service". A service to run tasks in independent threads the way you configure it.</p>
