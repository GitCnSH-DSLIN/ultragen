# UltraGen
Desktop/web multipurpose template engine/script language

Well, well... What to say? UltraGen is evolving and crossing the borders of a template engine. It's turning into a simple script language, suitable to many daily tasks. It now features commands as loop (a implementation of while), some comparison operators, copy and move file routines and a external process executor.

Now the web page PoC constructed with UltraGen is on repository but it's broken due to many changes to the language. Soon it will be stable again.
